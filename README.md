Alfred extension for Adium Chat
============

Alfred (http://www.alfredapp.com) extension to open chat and send messages in Adium.

Originally taken from http://urisdacosta.tumblr.com by Chris Kalani (http://chriskalani.com) but with one major change - try to start new chat in new tab of existed chat window instead of creating new chat window for every new chat.
